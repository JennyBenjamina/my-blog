In the world of technology, **Machine Learning (ML)** has emerged as a transformative force. It allows computers to learn from data and make intelligent decisions without being explicitly programmed. At the heart of every ML application are algorithms that power the learning process. In this article, we'll explore some fundamental machine learning algorithms and their applications.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in ML. It's used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load your dataset
X, y = load_dataset()

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```
